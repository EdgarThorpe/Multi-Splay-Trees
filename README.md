# Multi-Splay-Trees

This is a project that me and my team made for the CS201 (Data Structures And Algorithms) Course.

Project Name: Multi Splay Trees: Implementation and Analysis

##Summary
Our project entails the implementation and analysis of Multi Splay Trees in C++. We have analysed the run-time on some test cases. Here we will also analyse the amortized cost of Multi-Splay Trees by theoretical approach and also study its different properties such as Static Finger Property, Sequential Access Properties and various other lemmas associated with the topic of Multi-Splay Trees. We have used concepts such as BST(Binary Search Trees) and Splay Trees in the course of this project.

##Input 
The program doesn't require any user inputs.

##Expected Output
Build Time and Query Time for different set of test cases.

Test Cases  Sequential Access of elements in the BST having size 30, 3000 and 300000.  Reversal Access of elements in the BST having size 30, 3000 and 300000.  Random Access of elements in the BST having size 30, 3000 and 300000.
